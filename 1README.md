Virus
<!---
--->
I downloaded miktex at our library to test if it is the source of the trojan which has infected my latex for over a month.
Sadly it is. It tried a template and it would not work. It will not create a pdf. The virus renames other files by adding another file extension like dog.tex.bak. It is persistant and can't be removed with any antivirus I have used.
I will need to erase my ssd and pay to reinstall windows.
Unless you can see the file extensions you can not notice the problem and that tex don't work. 
There is chinese in the outline of the pdfs. I beleive this is a marker for the criminals to know to collect the data collected by the virus. 
I down loaded a tex file to notepad. It had a tex extension but was a html file with embeded .js code. Chrome does not allow java as a hint to others.
Any way to get this fixed so I can use miktex again?
